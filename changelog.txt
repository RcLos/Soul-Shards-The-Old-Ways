  - I think I did it right?

  - For every mob spawned, the amount of souls contained is decreased by 1.
  - This does not decrease the contained tier.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3.0
------------------------------------------------------

- Initial pre-release for Minecraft 1.9. You still need to wait for Forge to release builds.
  - Spawning is a bit... iffy. You'll see if you try it. Not sure if it's my fault or Forge's.

  - All compatibility has been disabled for now.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2.7
------------------------------------------------------

- Added compatibility with Blood Magic
  - Allows requiring use of LP in order for the Soul Cage to function.

  - Causes a nausea effect when not enough LP is available and the cage is activated. Disallows spawning.
- Config to disallow Cage Born mobs from counting towards Shard kill count
- [API] CageSpawnEvent now obtains it's tier value from the Shard instead of manually passing it. Shouldn't affect anybody.

- Moved multiblock recipe to JSON format
  - The X, Y, and Z are an offset from the block the player right clicked
  - Limitations:

    - The origin block must be the one to be right clicked. You cannot completely surround it by other blocks.
- Added a description to JEI for the Soul Shard
- Removed all references to the Soul Forge in code. It's just a machine that will be used once then never again. Sticking with the in-world creation.
